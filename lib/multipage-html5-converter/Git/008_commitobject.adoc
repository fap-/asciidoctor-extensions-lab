== The details of the commit objects

[[commit_object]]
=== Commit object (commit)
(((Commit object)))
(((Commit)))
Conceptually a commit object
(short:commit) represents a version of all files tracked in the
repository at the time the commit was created. Commits know their
parent(s) and this way capture the version history of the repository.

[[commit_objects]]
=== Technical details of a commit object

This commit object is addressable via a hash ( _SHA-1 checksum_ ). This
hash is calculated based on the content of the files, the content of the
directories, the complete history of up to the new commit, the
committer, the commit message, and several other factors.

This means that Git is safe, you cannot manipulate a file or the commit
message in the Git repository without Git noticing that corresponding
hash does not fit anymore to the content.

The _commit object_ points to the individual files in this commit via a
_tree_ object. The files are stored in the Git repository as _blob_
objects and might be packed by Git for better performance and more
compact storage. Blobs are addressed via their SHA-1 hash.

Packing involves storing changes as deltas, compression and storage of many objects in a single _pack file_. 
_Pack files_ are accompanied by one or multiple index files which speedup access to individual objects stored in these packs.

A commit object is depicted in the following picture.

The above picture is simplified. Tree objects point to other tree objects and file
blobs. Objects which didn't change between commits are reused by
multiple commits.

[[commits_sha_checksum]]
=== Hash and abbreviated commit hash
(((SHA-1 checksum in Git)))
(((Shortened SHA-1)))
(((Hash)))
(((Abbreviated commit hash)))
A Git commit object is identified by its
hash (SHA-1 checksum). SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. A
SHA-1 hash value is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40
digits long.

In a typical Git repository you need fewer characters to uniquely
identify a commit object. As a minimum you need 4 characters and in a
typical Git repository 5 or 6 are sufficient. This short form is called
the abbreviated commit hash or abbreviated hash. Sometimes it is also
called the shortened SHA-1 or abbreviated SHA-1.

Several commands, e.g., the `git log` command can be instructed to use
the shortened SHA-1 for their output.
