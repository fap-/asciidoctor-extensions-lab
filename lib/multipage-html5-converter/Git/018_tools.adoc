=== The Git command line tools

The core Git development team provides tooling for the command line via the the `git` command. 
Without any arguments, this command lists its options and the most common commands. 
You can get help for a certain Git command via the help command online option followed by the command. 

----
git help [command to get help for]
----

See all possible commands, use the `git help --all` command.

Git supports for several commands a short and a long version, similar to other Unix commands.
The short version uses a single hyphen and the long version uses two hyphen. 
The following two commands are equivalent.

----
git commit -m "This is a message"

git commit --message "This is a message"

=== Separating parameters and file arguments in Git commands

(((Separating files and parameter arguments in Git)))
(((Double hyphen (--) usage in Git)))
The double hyphens (--) in Git separates out any references or other options from a path (usually file names). 
For example, HEAD has a special meaning in Git. 
Using double hyphens allows you to distinguish between looking at a file called HEAD from a Git commit reference called HEAD.

In case Git can determine the correct parameters and options automatically the double hyphens can be avoided.

[source,console]
----
# seeing the git log for the HEAD file
git log -- HEAD

# seeing the git log for the HEAD reference
git log HEAD --

# if there is no HEAD file you can use HEAD as commit reference
git log HEAD
---- 

=== Graphical tools for Git

You can also use graphical tools. 
For example, the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse IDE] provides excellent support for working with Git repositories.

See http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis[GUI Clients] for an overview of the available tools
