=== Using an alias
(((alias)))
An _alias_ in Git allows you to create a short form of one or several existing Git commands. 
For example, you can define an alias which is a short form of your own favorite commands or you can combine several commands with an alias.

=== Alias examples

The following defines an _alias_ to see the staged changes with the new
`git staged` command.

[source,console]

include::res/alias/staged.txt[]

Or you can define an _alias_ for a detailed `git log` command. 
The following command defines the `git ll` _alias_.

[source,console]

include::res/alias/log.txt[]

You can also run external commands. 
In this case you start the _alias_ definition with a `!` character. 
For example, the following defines the `git ac` command which combines `git add . -A` and `git commit`
commands.
