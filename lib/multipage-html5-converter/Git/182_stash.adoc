[[stash_usage]]
== Stashing changes in Git

[[stash_usage1]]
=== The git stash command
(((stashing in Git)))
(((git stash)))
Git provides the `git stash` command which allows you to record the current state of the working directory and the staging
area and to revert to the last committed revision.

This allows you to pull in the latest changes or to develop an urgent
fix. Afterwards you can restore the stashed changes, which will reapply
the changes to the current version of the source code.

[[stash_usage2]]
=== When to use git stash

In general using the stash command should be the exception in using Git.
Typically, you would create new branches for new features and switch between branches. 
You can also commit frequently in your local Git repository and use interactive rebase to combine these commits later before pushing them to another Git repository.

Even if you prefer not to use branches, you can avoid using the `git stash` command. 
In this case you commit the changes you want to put aside and amend the commit with the next commit. 
If you use the approach of creating a commit, you typically put a marker in the commit message to mark it as a draft, e.g., "[DRAFT] implement feature x".

It is also possible to keep a list of stashes.

=== Create a branch from a stash 
(((Branch from stash)))
You can also create a branch for your stash if you want to continue to work on the stashed changes in a branch. 
This can be done with the following command.

[source,console]
----
