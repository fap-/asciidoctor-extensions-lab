== Editing history with the interactive rebase

(((Interactive rebase)))
Git allows you to edit your commit history with  a functionality called `interactive rebase`. 
For example, you can combine several commits into one commit, reorder or skip commits and edit the commit message.

This is useful as it allows the user to rewrite some commit history
(cleaning it up) before pushing the changes to a remote repository.

Interactive rebase allows you to quickly edit a series of commits using
the following actions:

.Interactive rebase actions
[cols="<27%,<73%",options="header",]
|====
|Action |Description
|pick |includes the selected commit, moving pick entries enables
reordering of commits

|skip |removes a commit

|edit |amends the commit

|squash |combines the changes of the commit with the previous commit and
combines their commit messages

|fixup |squashes the changes of a commit into the previous commit
discarding the squashed commit's message

|reword |similar to pick but allows modifying the commit message
|====

The setup for the rebase is called the _rebase plan_. 
Based on this plan, the actual interactive rebase can be executed.

[WARNING]
====
It is safe to use interactive rebase as long as the commits have not
been pushed to another repository. As the interactive rebase creates new
commit objects, other developers might be confused if you rebase already
published changes.

=== Example: Interactive rebase

The following commands create several commits which will be used for the
interactive rebase.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/git_rebase_commits[]
---- 

We want to combine the last seven commits. You can do this interactively via the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/rebase_i.txt[]
----

This command opens your editor of choice and lets you configure the rebase operation by defining which commits to _pick_, _squash_ or _fixup_.

The following listing shows an example of the selection. 
We pick the last commit, squash 5 commits and fix the sixth commit. 
The listing uses the long format of the commands (for example `fixup` instead of the short form `f` ) for better readability.
