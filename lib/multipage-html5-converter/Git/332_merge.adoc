[[gitmerge_definition]]
== Merging

(((Merging)))
(((git merge)))
Git allows you to combine the changes which were created on two different branches.
One way to achieve this is _merging_, which is described in this chapter. 
You can merge based on branches, tags or commits. Other ways are using rebase or cherry-pick.

This part explains how to merge changes between two different branches under the assumption that no merging conflicts happen.
Solving conflicts is covered in <<mergeconflict_definition>>.

[[gitmerge_fastforward]]
=== Fast-forward merge
(((Merging,fast-forward merge)))
If the commits which are merged are direct successors of the _HEAD_ pointer of the current branch, Git performs a so-called _fast forward merge_. 
This _fast forward merge_ only moves the _HEAD_ pointer of the current branch to the tip of the branch which is being merged. 

This process is depicted in the following diagram. The first picture
assumes that master is checked out and that you want to merge the
changes of the branch labeled "branch 1" into your "master" branch. Each
commit points to its predecessor (parent).

After the fast-forward merge the _HEAD_ points to the
master branch pointing to "Commit 3". The "branch 1" branch points to
the same commit.

[[gitmerge_mergecommit]]
=== Merge commit
(((Merging, merge commit)))
(((Merging, three-way-merge)))
(((Merging, Merge strategies)))
(((Merging, Recursive)))
If commits are merged which are not direct predecessors of the current
branch, Git performs a so-called _three-way-merge_ between the latest
commits of the two branches, based on the most recent common predecessor
of both.

As a result a so-called _merge commit_ is created on the current branch. 
It combines the respective changes from the two branches being merged. 
This commit points to both of its predecessors.

If multiple common predecessors exist, Git uses recursion to create a virtual common predecessor. 
For this Git creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference for the 3-way merge. 
This is called the _recursive merge_ strategy and is the default merge strategy.

[[gitmerge_octopus]]
=== Merge strategies - Octopus, Subtree, Ours

(((Merge strategies, Octopus)))
(((Merge strategies, Subtree)))
(((Merge strategies, Ours)))
(((Octopus merge strategy)))
(((Subtree merge strategy)))
(((Ours merge strategy)))
If a fast-forward merge is not possible, Git uses a merge strategy. 
The default strategy called _recursive merge_ strategy was described in <<gitmerge_mergecommit>>.

The Git command line tooling also supports the _octopus merge_ strategy for merges of multiple references. 
With this operation it can merge multiple branches at once.

The `subtree` option is useful when you want to merge in another project into a sub-directory of your current project. 
It is rarely used and you should prefer the usage of Git submodules. See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitSubmodules/article.html[Git Submodules] for more information.

The `ours` strategy merges a branch without looking at the changes introduced in this branch. 
This keeps the history of the merged branch but ignores the changes introduced in this branch.

You can use the _ours_ merge strategy to document that you have integrated a branch and decided to ignore all changes from this branch.


[[gitmergecommand_branches]]
=== Using the git merge command

The `git merge` command performs a merge. You can merge changes from one
branch to the current active one via the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/git_merge[]
----

[[gitmerge_mergeoptionsstrategies]]
=== Specifying merge strategies

The `-s` parameter allows you to specify other merge strategies. This is
demonstrated with the following command.

For example, you can specify the _ours_ strategy in which the result of
the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
ignoring all changes from all other branches. This is demonstrated with
the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/merge/mergeours.txt[]
----
 
[WARNING]
====
Be careful if you use the _ours_ merge strategy, it
ignores everything from the branch which is merged.
====

The usage of the octopus merge strategy is triggered if you specify more
than one reference to merge.

[source,console]
----
include::res/merge/mergeoctupus.txt[]
----

[[gitmerge_mergeoptions]]
=== Specifying parameters for the default merge strategy

The recursive merge strategy (default) allows you to specify flags with
the `-X` parameter. For example you can specify here the `ours` option.
This option forces conflicting changes to be auto-resolved by favoring
the local version. Changes from the other branch that do not conflict
with our local version are reflected to the merge result. For a binary
file, the entire contents are taken from the local version.

[WARNING]
====
The `ours` option for the _recursive_ merge strategy should not be
confused with the _ours_ merge strategy.
====

A similar option to `ours` is the `theirs` option. This option prefers
the version from the branch which is merged.

Both options are demonstrated in the following example code.

[source,console]
----
include::res/merge/mergeours2.txt[]
----
Another useful option is the `ignore-space-change` parameter which
ignores whitespace changes.

For more information about the merge strategies and options see
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html[Git
merge manpage].

[[gitmerge_forcemergecommit]]
=== Enforcing the creation of a merge commit

If you prefer to have merge commits even for situations in which Git
could perform a fast-forward merge you can use the `git merge --no-ff`
command.

The `--no-ff` parameter can make sense if you want to record in the
history at which time you merged from a maintenance branch to the master
branch.

When pulling from a remote repository, prefer doing a rebase to a merge.
This will help to keep the history easier to read. A merge commit can be
helpful to document that functionality was developed in parallel.
