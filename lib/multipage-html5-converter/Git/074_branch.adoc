== Using Branches

[[gitbranch_def]]
=== What are branches?

(((Branches in Git)))
Git allows you to create _branches_, i.e. named pointers to commits. 
You can work on different branches independently from each other. 
The default branch is most often called _master_.

A branch pointer in Git is 41 bytes large, 40 bytes of characters and an additional new line character. 
Therefore, the creating of branches in Git is very fast and cheap in terms of resource consumption. 
Git encourages the usage of branches on a regular basis.

If you decide to work on a branch, you _checkout_ this branch. 
This means that Git populates the _working tree_ with the version of the
files from the commit to which the branch points and moves the _HEAD_
pointer to the new branch.

As explained in <<gitterminology>> _HEAD_ is a symbolic reference usually pointing to the
branch which is currently checked out.


[[gitbranch_listbranches]]
=== List available branches

(((git branch)))
The `git branch` command lists all local branches. The currently active branch is marked with `*`.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/git_brancheslist.commands[]
----

If you want to see all branches (including remote-tracking branches), use the `-a` for the `git branch` command. 
See <<gitremotebranch_overview>> for information about remote-tracking branches.

[source,console]
----    
include::res/commandline/git_brancheslist2.commands[]
----

The `-v` option lists more information about the branches.

In order to list branches in a remote repository use the `git branch -r` command as demonstrated in the following example.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/git_brancheslist3.commands[]

[[gitbranch_createnewbranch]]
=== Create new branch

(((Branch, Create new branch)))
(((git branch)))
You can create a new branch via the `git branch [newname]` command. 
This command allows to specify the commit (commit id, tag, remote or local branch) to which the branch pointer original points. 
If not specified, the commit to which the HEAD reference points is used to create the new branch.

[source,console]
----
include::res/branch/git_create_branch[]
---- 

[[gitbranch_checkout]]
=== Checkout branch

(((checkout branch)))
(((git checkout)))
To start working in a branch you have to _checkout_ the branch. If you _checkout_ a branch, the HEAD pointer
moves to the last commit in this branch and the files in the working
tree are set to the state of this commit.

The following commands demonstrate how you switch to the branch called
_testing_, perform some changes in this branch and switch back to the
branch called _master_.

[source,console]
----
include::res/branch/git_checkout[]
----

To create a branch and to switch to it at the same time you can use the `git checkout` command with the `-b` parameter.

[source,console]

[[git_rename_branch]]
=== Rename a branch
(((rename branch)))
Renaming a branch can be done with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/branch/git_rename_branch[]
----

[[gitdeletebrach]]
=== Delete a branch

(((delete local branch)))
To delete a branch which is not needed anymore, you can use the following command. You may
get an error message that there are uncommited changes if you did the
previous examples step by step. Use force delete (uppercase `-D`) to
delete it anyway.

[source,console]
----
include::res/branch/git_delete_branch[]
---- 

[[gitpushbranch]]
=== Push changes of a branch to a remote repository

(((push branch)))
You can push the changes in a branch to a remote repository by specifying the target branch. 
This creates the target branch in the remote repository if it does not yet exist.

If you do not specify the remote repository, the `origin` is used as default

[source,console]
----
# push current branch to a branch called "testing" to remote repository
git push origin testing

# switch to the testing branch
git checkout testing

# some changes
echo "News for you" > test01
git commit -a -m "new feature in branch"

# push current HEAD to origin
git push

# make new branch
git branch anewbranch
# some changes
echo "More news for you" >> test01
git commit -a -m "a new commit in a feature branch"
# push anewbranch to the master in the origin
git push origin anewbranch:master

# get the changes into your local master
git checkout master
git pull
---- 

This way you can decide which branches you want to push to other repositories and which should be local branches. 
You learn more about branches and remote repositories in <<gitremotebranch_overview>>.


[[gitbranch_untrackedfiles]]
=== Switching branches with untracked files

(((switch branch, with untrack files)))
Untracked files (never added to the staging area) are unrelated to any branch. 
They exist only in the working tree and are ignored by Git until they are committed to the Git repository.
This allows you to create a branch for unstaged and uncommitted changes at any point in time.

[[gitbranch_dirtyfiles]]
=== Switching branches with uncommitted changes

(((switch branch,with uncommitted changes)))
Similar to untracked files you can switch branches with unstaged or staged modifications which are not yet committed.

You can switch branches if the modifications do not conflict with the files from the branch.

If Git needs to modify a changed file during the checkout of a branch, the checkout fails with a "checkout conflict" error.
This avoids that you lose changes in your files.

In this case the changes must be committed, reverted or stashed (see <<stash_usage1>>). 
You can also always create a new branch based on the current HEAD.

[[gitdiffbranches]]
=== Differences between branches

(((difference between branches)))
(((git diff, for branches)))
To see the difference between two branches you can use the following command.

[source,console]
----
# shows the differences between
# current head of master and your_branch

git diff master your_branch
----

You can use commit ranges as described in <<commitreference_ranges_doubledot>> and <<commitreference_ranges_tripledot>>. 
For example, if you compare a branch called _your_branch_ with the _master_ branch the following command shows the changes in _your_branch_ and _master_ since these branches diverged.

[source,console]

See <<gitdiffchapter>> for more examples of the `git diff` command.
