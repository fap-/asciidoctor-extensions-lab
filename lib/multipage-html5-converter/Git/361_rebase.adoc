=== Rebasing branches
(((git rebase)))
You can use Git to rebase one branch on another one. 
As described, the `merge` command combines the changes of two branches. 
If you rebase a branch called A onto another, the `git` command takes the changes introduced by the commits
of branch A and applies them based on the HEAD of the other branch. 
After this operation the changes in the other branch are also available in branch A.

The process is displayed in the following picture. We want to rebase the branch called `branch_1` onto master.

Running the rebase command creates a new commit with the changes of the branch on top of the master branch.

Performing a rebase does not create a merge commit. 
The final result for the source code is the same as with merge but the commit history is cleaner; the history appears to be linear.

Rebase can be used to forward-port a feature branch in the local Git repository onto the changes of the master branch. 
This ensures that your feature is close to the tip of the upstream branch until it is finally published.

If you rewrite more than one commit by rebasing, you may have to solve conflicts per commit. 
In this case the merge operations might be simpler to be performed because you only have to solve merge conflicts once.

Also, if your policy requires that all commits result in correct software you have to test all the rewritten commits since they are
"rewritten" by the rebase algorithm. 
Since merge/rebase/cherry-pick are purely text-based and do not understand the semantics of these texts they can end up with logically incorrect results. Hence, it might be
more efficient to merge a long feature branch into upstream instead of
rebasing it since you only have to review and test the merge commit.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the rebase command to change your Git repository history
commits. This is called _interactive_ rebase, see ? for information
about this feature.

[[rebase_bestpractice]]
=== Good practice for rebase

You should avoid using the Git rebase operation for changes which have
been published in other Git repositories. The Git rebase operation
creates new commit objects, this may confuse other developers using the
existing commit objects.

Assume that a user has a local feature branch and wants to push it to a
branch on the remote repository. However, the branch has evolved and
therefore pushing is not possible. Now it is good practice to fetch the
latest state of the branch from the remote repository. Afterwards you
rebase the local feature branch onto the remote tracking branch. This
avoids an unnecessary merge commit. This rebasing of a local feature
branch is also useful to incorporate the latest changes from remote into
the local development, even if the user does not want to push right
away.

[TIP]
====
Rebasing and amending commits is safe as long as you do not push any of
the changes involved in the rebase. For example, when you cloned a
repository and worked in this local repository. Rebasing is a great way
to keep the history clean before contributing back your modifications.
====

[WARNING]
====
In case you want to rewrite history for changes you have shared with
others you need to use the `-f` parameter in your `git push` command and
subsequently your colleagues have to use fetch -f to fetch the rewritten
commits.
