[[bisect_definition]]
=== Using git bisect
((git bisect))
The `git bisect` command allows you to run a binary search through the commit history to identify the commit which introduced an issue. 
You specify a range of commits and a script that the `bisect` command uses to identify whether a commit is good or bad.

This script must return 0 if the condition is fulfilled and non-zero if the condition is not fulfilled.

[[bisect_cloning]]
=== git bisect example

Create a new Git repository, create the `text1.txt` file and commit it
to the repository. Do a few more changes, remove the file and again do a
few more changes.

We use a simple shell script which checks the existence of a file.
Ensure that this file is executable.

[source,console]
----
include::res/bisect/check.sh[]
----

Afterwards use the `git bisect` command to find the bad commit. First
you use the `git bisect start` command to define a commit known to be
bad (showing the problem) and a commit known to be good (not showing the
problem).

[source,console]
----
include::res/bisect/bisect_start.txt[]
---- 

Afterwards run the bisect command using the shell script.

[source,console]
----
include::res/bisect/bisectrun.txt[]
----

[TIP]
====
The above commands serve as an example. 
The existence of a file can be easier verified with the `git bisect` command:
`git bisect run test -f test1.txt`
