== Rewriting commit history with git filter-branch

[[filterbranch_definition]]
=== Using git filter-branch
(((git filter-branch)))
The `git filter-branch` command allows you to rewrite the Git commit history.
This can be done for selected branches and you can  apply custom filters on each revision. 
This creates different hashes for all modified commits. 
This implies that you get new IDs for all commits based on any rewritten commit.

The command allows you to filter for several values, e.g., the author,
the message, etc. For details please see the following link:

Manual Page]

[WARNING]
====
Using the `filter-branch` command is dangerous as it changes the Git
repository. It changes the commit IDs and reacting on such a change
requires explicit action from the developer, e.g., trying to rebase the
stale local branch onto the corresponding rewritten remote-tracking
branch.
====

For example, you can use `git filter-branch` if you want to remove a file which contains a password from the Git history.
Or you want to remove huge binary files from the history.
To completely remove such files, you need to run the `filter-branch` command on all branches.
