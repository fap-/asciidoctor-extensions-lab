((git checkout, based on commit ID))

You can check out arbitrary revisions of your file
system via the git checkout command followed by the commit ID. This
command will reset your complete _working tree_ to the status described
by this commit.

The commit ID is shown if you enter the `git log` command.

The following command shows the log.

[WARNING]
====
If you checkout a commit, you are in the _detached head mode_ and commits in this mode are harder to find after you checkout another branch. 
Before committing it is good practice to create a new branch.
See <<detachedheadmode>> for details.
