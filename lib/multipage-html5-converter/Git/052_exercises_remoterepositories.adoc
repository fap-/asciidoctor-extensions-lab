[[exercise_workingwithremotes]]
== Exercise: Working with a (local) remote repository

This exercise is based on <<firstgit>>.
You now create a local bare repository based on your existing Git repository.
In order to simplify the examples, the Git repository is hosted locally in the filesystem and not on a server in the Internet.

Afterwards you pull from and push to your bare repository to synchronize changes between your repositories.
