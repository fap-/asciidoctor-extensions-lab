== Recovering lost commits

[[detachedheadmode]]
=== Detached HEAD
(((Detached HEAD)))
If you checkout a commit
or a tag, you are in the so-called _detached HEAD mode_. If you commit
changes in this mode, you have no branch which points to this commit.
After you checkout a branch you cannot see the commit you did in
detached head mode in the `git log` command.

To find such commits you can use the `git reflog` command.

[[gitreflog_definition]]

=== git reflog
(((git reflog)))
Reflog is a mechanism to record the movements of the _HEAD_ and the branches references.

The reflog command gives a history of the complete changes of the _HEAD_ reference.

The `git reflog` command also list commits which you have removed.

[TIP]
====
There are multiple reflogs: one per branch and one for HEAD. For
branches use the `git reflog [branch]` command and for HEAD use the
`git reflog` or the `git reflog HEAD` command.

[[gitreflog_example]]
=== Example

The following example shows how you can use git reflog to reset the
current local branch to a commit which isn't reachable from the current
branch anymore.
