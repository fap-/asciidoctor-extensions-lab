[[firstgit]]
== Exercise: Performing a local Git workflow

In this exercise, you learn how to create and work with a local Git repository.

Open a command shell for the operations. 
Some commands are Linux specific, e.g., appending to a file or creating a directory. 
Substitute these commands with the commands of your operating system.
The comments (marked with #) before the commands explain the specific actions.

[[firstgit_directory]]
=== Create a directory

The following commands create an empty directory which is used later in
this exercise to contain the working tree and the Git repository.

[source,console]
----
# switch to the home directory
cd

# create a directory and switch into it
mkdir repo01
cd repo01

# create a new directory
mkdir datafiles
----

[[firstgit_repository_creation]]
=== Create a new Git repository

You now create a new Git repository with a working tree. 

Every Git repository is stored in the `.git` folder of the directory in which the Git repository has been created. 
This directory contains the complete history of the repository. 
The `.git/config` file contains the configuration for the repository.

Use the `git init` command to create a Git repository in the current directory. 
Git does not care whether you start with an empty directory or if it contains already files.

[source,console]
----
# you should still be in the repo01 directory
cd ~/repo01

# initialize the Git repository
# for the current directory
git init
---- 

All files inside the repository folder, excluding the `.git` folder, are the _working tree_ for a Git repository.


[[firstgit_content]]
=== Create new content

Use the following commands to create several new files.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/first.commands[]
---- 

[[firstgit_repostatus]]
=== See the current status of your repository

The `((git status))` command shows the status of the working tree, i.e. which files have changed, which are
staged and which are not part of the staging area. It also shows which
files have conflicts and gives an indication what the user can do with
these changes, e.g., add them to the staging area or remove them, etc.

Run it via the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/first.status[]
---- 

The output looks similar to the following listing.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/first.output[]
---- 

[[firstgit_repoadd]]
=== Add changes to the staging area

Before committing changes to a Git repository, you need to mark the changes that should be committed with the `((git add))` command.
This command allows adding changes in the file system to the staging area.
It creates a snapshot of the affected files. 
You can add all changes to the staging area with the `.` option or changes in individual files but specifying a file pattern as option.

[source,console]
----
# add all files to the index of the Git repository
git add .
---- 

Afterwards run the `git status` command again to see the current status. 
The following listing shows the output of this command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitrepo_add.result[]
----
 
[[firstgit_changefiles]]
=== Change files that are staged

In case you change one of the staged files before committing, you need to add the changes again to the staging area, to commit the new changes. 
This is because Git creates a snapshot of the content of a staged file. 
All new changes must again be staged.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitrepo_changestaged[]
----

Validate that the new changes are not yet staged.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitrepo_changestaged.result[]
----

Add the new changes to the staging area.

[source,console]
----
# add all files to the index of the Git repository
git add .
----

Use the `git status` command again to see that all changes are staged.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitrepo_changestaged.finalresult[] 
----

[[firstgit_repocommit]]
=== Commit staged changes to the repository

After adding the files to the Git staging area, you can commit them to the Git repository with the `((git commit))` command. 
This creates a new commit object with the staged changes in the Git repository and the HEAD reference points to the new commit. 
The `-m` parameter (or its long version: ``--message``) allows you to specify the commit message. 
If you leave this parameter out, your default editor is started and you can enter the message in the editor.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitrepo_commit[]
----

[[firstgitresult_results]]

[TIP]
====
Git also offers a mode that lets you choose interactively which changes you want to commit.
After you quit the mode you will be asked to provide a commit message in your $EDITOR.

[source,terminal]
----
include::res/commandline/git_commit_interactive[]
----
====

=== Viewing the Git commit history

The Git operations you performed have created a local Git repository in the `.git` folder and added all files to this repository via one commit.
Run the `git log` command to see the history.

[source,console]
----
# show the Git log for the change
git log
----

You see an output similar to the following.

[source,console]
----
include::res/gitfirst/gitlog-output.txt[]
---- 

=== Viewing the changes of a commit

Use the `git show` command to see the changes of a commit. 
If you specify a commit reference as third parameter, this is used to determine the changes, otherwise the _HEAD_ reference is used.

[[firstgitresult_directory]]
=== Review the resulting directory structure

Review the resulting directory structure. 
Your directory contains the Git repository as well as the Git working tree for your files. 
This directory structure is depicted in the following screenshot.

image::firstgit-directory10.png[First Git directory, pdfwidth=30%] 

[[firstgit_deletefile]]
=== Remove files
(((Repository, remove files)))
If you delete a file, you use the `git add .` command to add the deletion of a file to the staging area. 

[source,console]
----
# remove the "test03" file
rm test03
# add and commit the removal
git add .
# if you use Git version < 2.0 use: git add -A .
git commit -m "Removes the test03 file"
----

Alternatively you can use the `git rm` command to delete the file from your working tree and record the deletion of the file in the staging area.

[[firstgit_checkout]]
=== Revert changes in files in the working tree
(((Remove changes in the working tree)))
(((Undo changes in the working tree)))
Use the `git checkout` command to reset a tracked file (a file that was once
staged or committed) to its latest staged or commit state. The command
removes the changes of the file in the working tree. This command cannot
be applied to files which are not yet staged or committed.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/checkout.txt[]
----

If you use `git status` command to see that there are no changes
left in the working directory.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/checkout_result.txt[]
----

[WARNING]
====
Use this command carefully. 
The `git checkout` command deletes the  unstaged and uncommitted changes of tracked files in the working tree and it is not possible to restore this deletion via Git.
====

[[firstgit_amend]]
=== Correct the changes of the commit with git amend
(((git amend)))
(((change last commit)))
The `git commit --amend` command makes it possible to rework the changes of the last commit.
It creates a new commit with the adjusted changes.

[NOTE]
====
The amended commit is still available until a clean-up job removes it.
But it is not included in the `git log` output hence it does not distract the user.
See <<gitreflog_definition>> for details.
====

Assume the last commit message was incorrect as it contained a typo. 
The following command corrects this via the `--amend` parameter.

[source,console]
----
# assuming you have something to commit
git commit -m "message with a tpyo here"
----

[source,console]
----
# amend the last commit
git commit --amend -m "More changes - now correct"
----

You should use the `git --amend` command only for commits which have not been pushed to a public branch of another Git repository. 
The `git --amend` command creates a new commit ID and people may have based their work already on the existing commit. 
If that would be the case, they would need to migrate their work based on the new commit.

[[usegitignore]]
=== Ignore files and directories with the .gitignore file
(((.gitignore)))
(((gitignore file)))
Create the following `.gitignore` file in the root of your Git directory to ignore the specified directory and file.

[source,console]
----
cd ~/repo01
touch .gitignore
echo ".metadata/" >> .gitignore
echo "doNotTrackFile.txt" >> .gitignore
---- 

[NOTE]
====
The above command creates the file via the command line. 
A more common approach is to use your favorite text editor to create the file. 
This editor must save the file as plain text. 
Editors which do this are for example _gedit_ under Ubuntu or _Notepad_ under Windows.
====

The resulting file looks like the following listing.

[source,console]
----
.metadata/
doNotTrackFile.txt
----

[[commitgitignore]]

=== Commit the .gitignore file

It is good practice to commit the `.gitignore` file into the Git repository. 
Use the following commands for this.

[source,console]
----
# add the .gitignore file to the staging area
git add .gitignore
# commit the change
git commit -m "Adds .gitignore file"
----
