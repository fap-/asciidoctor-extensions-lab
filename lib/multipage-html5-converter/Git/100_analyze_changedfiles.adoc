[[gitstatus]]
=== Listing changed files
(((git status)))
The `git status` command shows the current status of your repository and possible actions which you can perform.

It shows which files have changed, which are staged and which are not part of the staging area. 
It also shows which files have merge conflicts and gives an indication what the user can do with these changes, e.g., add them to the staging area or
remove them, etc.

[TIP]
====
`git status -u` shows all untracked files. 
Otherwise, if you have a new directory with severals files, only the directory is shown.

[[gitstatus_example]]
=== Example: Using git status

The following commands create some changes in your Git repository.

.Make some changes in your working tree
[source,console]
----
# assumes that the test01  and test02 files exist
# and have been committed in the past 
echo "This is a new change to the file" > test01
echo "and this is another new change" > test02

# create a new file
ls > newfileanalyzis.txt
----

Now use the status command.

[source,console]
----
git status
----

The output of the command looks like the following listing.

[source,console]
----
include::res/log/status3.txt[]

git diff --cached # <2>

git diff COMMMIT_REF1 COMMMIT_REF2 #<3>

git diff -- [file_reference] # <4>
---- 

<1> shows the changes introduced in the working tree compared with the staging area
<2> shows the differences  between the staging area and the last commit
<3> shows the differences introduced between two commits references
<4> shows the differences introduced in the working tree compared with the staging area for [file_reference]
