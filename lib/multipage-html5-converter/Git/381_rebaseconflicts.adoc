== Solving rebase conflicts

[[rebaseconflict_definition]]
=== What is a conflict during a rebase operation?
((Rebase conflict))
During a rebase operation, several commits are applied onto a certain commit. 
If you rebase a branch onto another branch, this commit is the last common ancestor of the two branches.

For each commit which is applied it is possible that a conflict occurs.

[[rebaseconflict_solving]]
== Handling a conflict during a rebase operation

If a conflict occurs during a rebase operation, the rebase operation
stops and the developer needs to resolve the conflict. After he has
solved the conflicts, the developer instructs Git to continue with the
rebase operation.

A conflict during a rebase operation is solved similarly to the way a
conflict during a merge operation is solved. The developer edits the
conflicts and adds the files to the Git index. Afterwards he continues
the rebase operation with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/rebasecontinue.txt[]
----

To see the files which have a rebase conflict use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/conflictingfiles.txt[]
---- 

You solve such a conflict the same way as you would solve a merge conflict.

You can also skip the commit which creates the conflict.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/rebaseskip.txt[]
----

[[rebaseconflict_abort]]
== Aborting a rebase operation

You can also abort a rebase operation with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/rebaseabort.txt[]
----

[[rebaseconflict_theirs]]
== Picking theirs or ours for conflicting file
(((Rebase conflict,theirs parameter))) 
(((Rebase conflict)))
If a file is in conflict, you can instruct Git to take the version from the new commit of the version of commit onto which the new changes are applied. 
This is sometimes easier than to solve all conflicts manually.
For this you can use the `git checkout` with the `--theirs` or `--ours`
flag. During the conflict `--ours` points to the file in the commit onto
which the new commit is placed, i.g., using this skips the new changes
for this file.

Therefore to ignore the changes in a commit for a file use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/ours.txt[]
----
To take the version of the new commit use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/rebase/theirs.txt[]
----
