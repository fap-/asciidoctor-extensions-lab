== Solving merge conflicts

[[mergeconflict_definition]]
=== What is a conflict during a merge operation?
((Merge conflict))
A conflict during a
merge operation occurs if two commits from different branches have
modified the same content and Git cannot automatically determine how
both changes should be combined when merging these branches.

This happens for example if the same line in a file has been replaced by
two different commits.

If a conflict occurs, Git marks the conflict in the file and the
programmer has to resolve the conflict manually.

After resolving it, he adds the file to the staging area and commits the
change. These steps are required to finish the merge operation.

LARSSECONDARY"ours parameter"LARSSECONDARY Sometimes if a conflict
occurs the developer does not want to solve the conflict. He decides
that he wants to keep the original version or the new version of the
file.

For this, there is the `--theirs` and the `--ours` options on the
`git checkout` command. The first option keeps the version of the file
that you merged in, and the second option keeps the version before the
merge operation was started.
