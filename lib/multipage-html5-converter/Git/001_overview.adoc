== What is a version control system?

(((Version control system)))
A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the history of a collection of files. 
It supports creating different versions of this collection. 
Each version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point in time and the VCS allows you to switch between these versions. 
These versions are stored in a specific place, typically called a _repository_.

You may, for example, revert the collection of files to a state from 2 days ago. 
Or you may switch between versions of your files for experimental features.
The process of creating different versions (snapshots) in the repository is depicted in the following graphic. 
Please note that this picture fits primarily to Git. 
Other version control systems like _Concurrent Versions System_ (CVS) don't create snapshots of the files but store file deltas.

VCS are typically used to track changes in text files.
These text files can for example be source code for a programming language, HTML or configuration files. 
Of course, version control systems are not limited to text files, they can also handle other types of files.
For example, you may use a VCS to track the different versions of a png file.

== Localized and centralized version control systems

A localized version control system keeps local copies of the files. 
This approach can be as simple as creating a manual copy of the relevant files.
 
A centralized version control system provides a server software component which stores and manages the different versions of the files.
A developer can copy (checkout) a certain version from the central sever onto their individual computer.

Both approaches have the drawback that they have one single point of failure.
In a localized version control systems it is the individual computer and in a centralized version control systems it is the server machine. 
Both system makes it also harder to work in parallel on different features.

== Distributed version control systems

(((Version control system, distributed version control system)))
In a distributed version control system each user has a complete local copy of a repository on his individual computer. 
The user can copy an existing repository. 
This copying process is typically called _cloning_ and the resulting repository can be referred to as a _clone_.

Every clone contains the full history of the collection of files and a cloned repository has the same functionality as the original repository.

Every repository can exchange versions of the files with other repositories by transporting these changes. 
This is typically done via a repository running on a server which is, unlike the local machine of a developer, always online. 
Typically, there is a central server for keeping a repository but each cloned repository is a full copy of this repository. 
The decision which of the copies is considered to be the central server repository is pure convention.
