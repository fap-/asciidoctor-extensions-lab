[[undochanges]]
== Revert uncommitted changes in tracked files

[[undochanges_usecase]]
=== Use cases

If you have a tracked file in Git, you can always recreate the file
content based on the staging area or based on a previous commit. You can
also remove staged changes from the staging area to avoid that these
changes are included in the next commit. This chapter explain you how
you can do this.

[[undochanges_reset]]
=== Remove staged changes from the staging area
((Staging area, remove staged changes))
You can use the `git reset [paths]`
command to remove staged changes from the staging area. This means that
`git reset [paths]` is the opposite of `git add [paths]`. It avoids
that the changes are included in the next commit. The changes are still
available in the working tree, e.g., you will not lose your changes and
can stage and commit them at a later point.

In the following example you create a new file and change an existing
file. Both changes are staged.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/stageunwantedchanges.txt[]
----

The output of `git status` command should look similar to the following.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/stageunwantedchanges_result.txt[]
----

Remove the changes from the staging area with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/unstage.txt[]
----

Use the `git status` command to see the result.

[source,console]
----
include::res/deletefile/unstage_result.txt[]
----

The `git reset`
behaves differently depending on the options you provide. To learn more about the `git reset` command see <<gitreset>>.

[[undochanges_checkout]]
=== Remove changes in the working tree
(((git checkout, Checkout version from staging area)))
(((Undo changes in the working tree)))
[WARNING]
====
Be careful with the
following command. It allows you to override the changes in files in
your working tree. You will not be able to restore these changes.
====

Changes in the working tree which are not staged can be undone with
`git checkout` command. This command resets the file in the working tree
to the latest staged version. If there are no staged changes, the latest
committed version is used for the restore operation.

[source,console]
----
include::res/delete/git_checkoutfile.txt[]
---- 

For example, you can restore the content of a directory called
`data` with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/delete/restoredir_notstaged.txt[]
----
 
[[undochanges_directorydeletion]]
=== Remove changes in the working tree and the staging area
(((git checkout, undo staged changes)))
If you want to undo a staged but uncommitted
change, you use the `git checkout [commit-pointer] [paths]` command.
This version of the command resets the working tree and the staged area.

The following demonstrates the usage of this to restore a delete
directory.

[source,console]
----
include::res/delete/restoredir.txt[]
----

The additional commit pointer parameter instructs the `git checkout`
command to reset the working tree and to also remove the staged changes.

[[undochanges_indexexisting]]
=== Remove staging area based on last commit change

When you have added the changes of a file to the staging area, you can
also revert the changes in the staging area base on the last commit.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/git_revert[]
