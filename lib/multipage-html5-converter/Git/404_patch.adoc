== Working with patch files

[[gitpatch]]
=== What is a patch file?
(((Patch)))
A _patch_ is a text file that contains changes to other text files in a standarized format.
A patch created with the `git format-patch` command includes meta-information about the commit
(committer, date, commit message, etc) and also contains the changes introduced in binary data in the commit.

This file can be sent to someone else and the receiver can use it to apply the changes to his local repository. 
The metadata is preserved.

Alternatively you could create a diff file with the `git diff` command, but this diff file does not contain the metadata information.




[[gitpatch_createandapply]]
=== Create and apply patches
(((Create patch)))
(((git format-patch)))
The following example creates a branch, changes several files and creates a commit recording these changes.

[source,console]
----
include::res/patch/patch1.txt[]
----
 The
next example creates a patch for these changes.

[source,console]
----
include::res/patch/patch2.txt[]
----

To apply this patch to your master branch in a different clone of the repository, switch to it and use the `git apply` command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/patch/patch3.txt[]
----

Afterwards you can commit the changes introduced by the patches and delete the patch file.

[source,console]
----
include::res/patch/patch4.txt[]
----

[TIP]
====
Use the `git am` command to apply and commit the changes in a single step. 
To apply and commit all patch files in the directory use, for example, the `git am *.patch` command. You specify the order in
which the patches are applied by specifying them on the command line.

[[gitpatch_createforcommit]]
=== Create a patch for a selected commit

You can specify the commit ID and the number of patches which should be
created. For example, to create a patch for selected commits based on
the HEAD pointer you can use the following commands.

[source,console]
----
include::res/patch/patch5.txt[]
