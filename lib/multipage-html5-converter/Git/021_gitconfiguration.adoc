[[setup_configurationlevels]]
=== Git configuration levels

The `git config` command allows you to configure your Git settings.
These settings can be system wide, user or repository specific.

A more specific setting overwrites values in the previous level.
A setting for the repository overrides the user setting and a user setting overrides a system wide setting.

[[setup_systemwideconfiguration]]

==== Git system-wide configuration 
(((System wide Git configuration))) 
(((Configuration, System wide configuration)))
You can provide a system wide configuration for your Git settings. 
A system wide configuration is not very common.
Most settings are user specific or repository specific as described in the next chapters.

On a Unix based system, Git uses the `/etc/gitconfig` file for this system-wide configuration. 
To set this up, ensure you have sufficient rights, i.e. root rights, in your OS and use the `--system` option for the `git config` command.

[[setup_userconfiguration]]
==== Git user configuration 
(((Configuration, User specific configuration))) 
(((User specific Git configuration )))
Git allows you to store user settings in the `.gitconfig` file located in the user home directory. 
This is also called the _global_ Git configuration.

For example Git stores the committer and author of a change in each commit. 
This and additional information can be stored in the Git user settings.

In each Git repository you can also configure the settings for this repository. 
User configuration is done if you include the `--global` option in the `git config` command.

[[setup_configuration]]
==== Repository specific configuration 
(((Configuration, repository specific configuration))) 
(((Repository specific Git configuration )))
You can also store repository specific settings in the `.git/config` file of a repository.
Use the `--local` or use no flag at all. 
If neither the `--system` not the `--global` parameter is used, the setting is specific for the current Git repository.

[[gitsetup_user]]
=== User credential configuration
(((Configuration, user and email)))
You have to configure at least your user and email address to be able to commit to a Git repository because this information is stored in each commit.

[source,console]
----
# configure the user which will be used by Git
# this should be not an acronym but your full name
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"

# configure the email address
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.org"
---- 

[[gitsetup_pushconfiguration]]
=== Push configuration
(((Configuration, push configuration)))
If your are using Git in a version below 2.0 you should also execute the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/commandline/setup_pushmatching.txt[]
----

This configures Git so that the `git push` command pushes only the active branch to your Git remote repository. 
As of Git version 2.0 this is the default and therefore it is good practice to configure this behavior.

You learn about the push command in <<cloneremotes_push>>.

[[autosetuprebase]]
=== Avoid merge commits for pulling
(((Configuration, autosetuprebase)))
(((autosetuprebase)))
By default, Git runs the `git fetch`  followed by the `git merge` command if you use the `git pull` command. 
You can configure git to use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` for the pull command via the following setting.

[source,console]
----
# set default so that you avoid unnecessary commits
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
---- 

[NOTE]
====
This setting helps avoiding merge commits during the pull operation which synchronizes your Git repository with a remote repository.
The author of this {contentidentifier} always uses this setting for his Git repositories.
====

=== Allow rebasing with uncommited changes

If you want Git to automatically save your uncommited changes before a rebase you can activate autoStash.
After the rebase is done your changes will get reapplied.
For an explanation of `git stash` please see <<stash_usage>>.

[source, console]
----
include::res/commandline/gitconfig_rebase_autoStash[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Before Git v2.6 `git pull --rebase` didn't respected this setting.
====

[[setup_highlighting]]

=== Color Highlighting
(((Configuration, color highlighting)))
The following commands enables color highlighting for Git in the console.

[source,console]
----
include::res/highlight/color.txt[]
----
 
[[setup_editor]]
=== Setting the default editor
(((Configuration, default editor)))
By default Git uses the system default editor which
is taken from the _VISUAL_ or _EDITOR_ environment variables if set. You
can configure a different one via the following setting.

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/editor.txt[]
----
 
[[setup_mergetool]]
=== Setting the default merge tool
(((Configuration, default merge tool)))
File conflicts might occur in Git during an
operation which combines different versions of the same files. In this
case the user can directly edit the file to resolve the conflict.

Git allows also to configure a merge tool for solving these conflicts.
You have to use third party visual merge tools like tortoisemerge,
p4merge, kdiff3 etc. A Google search for these tools help you to install
them on your platform. Keep in mind that such tools are not required,
you can always edit the files directly in a text editor.

Once you have installed them you can set your selected tool as default
merge tool with the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/mergetool.txt[] 
----

[[setup_allsetttings]]
=== More settings

All possible Git settings are described under the following link:
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html[git-config
manual page]

[[setup_seesettings]]
=== Query Git settings
(((Configuration, query existing configuration)))
To query your Git settings, execute the following command:

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/listsettings.txt[]
---- 

If you want to query the global settings you can use the following
command.

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/listsettingsglobal.txt[] 
----
