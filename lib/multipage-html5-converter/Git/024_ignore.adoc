=== Ignoring files and directories with a .gitignore file 
(((Ignore files))) 
(((.gitignore)))
Git can be configured to ignore certain files and directories for repository operations. 
This is configured via one or several `.gitignore` files. 
Typically, this file is located at the root of your Git repository but it can also be located in sub-directories. 
In the second case the defined rules are only valid for the sub-directory and below.

You can use certain wildcards in this file. 
`*` matches several characters. 
More patterns are possible and described under the following
URL: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html[gitignore manpage]

For example, the following `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the `bin` and `target` directories and all files ending with a ~.

[source,console]
----
include::res/ignore/gitignore[]
----

You can create the `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the working
tree to make it specific for the Git repository.


[TIP]
====
The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the specified files in Git commands. 
You can still add ignored files to the _staging area_ of the Git repository by using the `--force` parameter, i.e. with the `git add --force [paths]` command.

This is useful if you want to add, for example, auto-generated binaries,
but you need to have a fine control about the version which is added and
want to exclude them from the normal workflow.
====

It is good practice to commit the local `.gitignore` file into the Git
repository so that everyone who clones this repository have it.


[[gitignore_untrack]]
=== Stop tracking files based on the .gitignore file 
(((.gitignore, remove already committed files)))
Files that are tracked by Git are not automatically removed if you add them to a `.gitignore` file. 
Git never ignores files which are already tracked, so changes in the `.gitignore` file only affect new files. 
If you want to ignore files which are already tracked you need to explicitly remove them.

The following command demonstrates how to remove the `.metadata`
directory and the `doNotTrackFile.txt` file from being tracked. This is
example code, as you did not commit the corresponding files in your
example, the command will not work in your Git repository.

[source,console]
----

# remove directory .metadata from git repo
git rm -r --cached .metadata
# remove file test.txt from repo
git rm --cached doNotTrackFile.txt
----

Adding a file to the `.gitignore` file does not remove the file from the
repository history. If the file should also be removed from the history,
have a look at the `git filter-branch` command which allows you to
rewrite the commit history. See <<filterbranch_definition>> for details.

[[global-cross-repository-gitignore-settings]]
=== Global (cross-repository) .gitignore settings

You can also setup a global `.gitignore` file valid for all Git
repositories via the `core.excludesfile` setting. The setup of this
setting is demonstrated in the following code snippet.

[source,console]
----
include::res/gitignore/global.txt[] 
----

The global `.gitignore` file is only locally available.

[[local-per-repository-ignore-rules]]
=== Local per-repository ignore rules

You can also create local per-repository rules by editing the
`.git/info/exclude` file in your repository. These rules are not
committed with the repository so they are not shared with others.

This allows you to exclude, for example, locally generated files.


[[tracking_empty_directories]]
=== Tracking empty directories with Git 

(((Empty directory handling in Git)))
(((Tracking an empty directory in Git)))
Git ignores empty directories, i.e., it does not put them under version control.
If you want to track an empty directory in your Git repository, it is a good practice to put a file called `.gitignore` in the directory. 
As the directory now contains a file, Git includes it into its version control mechanism.

[NOTE]
====
The file could be called anything. 
Some people suggest to call the file `.gitkeep`. 
One problem with this approach is that `.gitkeep` is unlikely to be ignored by build systems. 
This may result  in the `.gitkeep` file being copied to the output repository, which is typically not desired.
