[[retrievefiles]]
== Retrieving files from the history

[[retrievefiles_show]]
=== View file in different revision
(((git show)))
The `git show` command allows
to see and retrieve files from branches, commits and tags. It allows
seeing the status of these files in the selected branch, commit or tag
without checking them out into your working tree.

By default, this command addresses a file from the root of the
repository, not the current directory. If you want the current directory
then you have to use the ./ specifier. For example to address the
`pom.xml` file the current directory use: `./pom.xml`

The following commands demonstrate that. You can also make a copy of the
file.

=== Restore a deleted file in a Git repo
