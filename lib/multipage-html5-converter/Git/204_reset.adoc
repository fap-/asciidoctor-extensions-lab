[[resetcommits]]
== Resetting changes with git reset

[[findingresettedcommits]]
=== Finding commits that are no longer visible on a branch

If you reset the branch pointer of a branch to a certain commit, the
`git log` commands does not show the commits which exist after this
branch pointer. For example assume you have two commits A-> B, where B
is the commit after A. You if you reset your branch pointer to A, the
`git log` command does not include B anymore.

Commits like B can still be found via the `git reflog` command. See <<gitreflog>>.

[[cleanworkingdir]]
== Deleting changes in the working tree and staging area for tracked files

The `git reset --hard` command makes the working tree exactly match HEAD.

[WARNING]
====
If you have tracked files with modifications, you
lose these changes with the above command.

[NOTE]
====
The reset command does not delete untracked files. If you want to delete
them also see <<gitreflog>>.

[[resettosquash]]
=== Using git reset to squash commits
((git reset, squash  commits))
As a soft reset does not remove your change to
your files and index, you can use the `git reset --soft` command to
squash several commits into one commit.

As the staging area is not changed with a soft reset, you keep it in the
desired state for your new commit. This means that all the file changes
from the commits which were reseted are still part of the staging area.

The interactive rebase adds more flexibility to squashing commits and allows to use the existing commit messages. See <<interactive_rebase>> for details.
