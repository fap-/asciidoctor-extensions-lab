== Migrating from SVN
(((svn)))
(((migration)))
To convert Subversion projects to Git you can use a RubyGem called _svn2git_. 
This tool relies on `git svn` internally and handles most of the trouble.

To install it (on Ubuntu) simply type:

[source,console]
----
include::res/migration/svn2git_install.txt[]
----

Let's say you have a repository called 

....
http://svn.example.com/repo
....

with the default layout (trunk, branches, tags) and already prepared a local git repository where you want to put everything. 
Then navigate to your git directory and use the following commands:

[source,console]
----
include::res/migration/svn2git_example.txt[]
----

The parameter `--verbose` adds detailed output to the commandline so you can see what is going on including potential errors. 
The second `svn2git --rebase` command aligns your new git repository with the svn import. 
You are now ready to push to the web and get forked! 
If your svn layout deviates from the standard or other problems occur, seek `svn2git --help` for documentation on additional parameters.
